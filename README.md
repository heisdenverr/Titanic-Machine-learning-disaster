# Titanic-Machine-learning-disaster
Here's my sample project on Space Titanic Machine learning

I took on the Challenge on Kaggle to tackle this Classification problem and I got an accuracy score 79%

If you'd like to know more about how i did this, go ahead and fork this repository

## Beginning 

Well I began with this:
* Data collection 
* Data preprocessing 
* Data manipulation 
* Data visualization 
* Applying Machine Learning Algorithm 
* Make Predictions 

## What I learnt 

Looking at this [Titanic](https://github.com/heisdenverr/Titanic-Machine-learning-disaster/blob/master-branch/Titanic/Titanic%20preds.ipynb) model
After cleaning my data I should have user ~pd.get_dummies to get a dummy variable for my categorical features and for my Numerical features checking the Summary of the datasets with Df.describe() shows few features that are useful.
Left for me to Visualize my data comparing every feature to its target and get what's going on with this I now have an insight on my data and I can finally build my Machine Learning algorithm
Though it's a Classification problem, I think Logistic Regression will be the Perfect model using Stochastic Gradient descent as the learning Algorithm, also setting the threshold to >= 0.5.



* I'm making corrections to my Machine Learning Milestone Project
