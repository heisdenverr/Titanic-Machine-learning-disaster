# Titanic-Machine-learning-disaster
Here's my sample project on Space Titanic Machine learning

I took on the Challenge on Kaggle to tackle this Classification problem and I got an accuracy score 79%

If you'd like to know more about how i did this, go ahead and fork this repository

## Beginning 

Well I began with this:
* Data collection 
* Data preprocessing 
* Data manipulation 
* Data visualization 
* Applying Machine Learning Algorithm 
* Make Predictions 

## What I learnt
